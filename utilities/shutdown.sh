# `minecraft_root` should be the base directory everything minecraft-related is
# installed to, usually /minecraft. This script can be run in two different
# modes, depending on whether it is backgrounded (&) or not.
#
# "Daemon" Mode
#
# Every 5 seconds, checks whether the instance is going to be shut down or
# terminated soon. If the instance is to be stopped or terminated, performs the
# same steps as Active mode.
#
# "Active" Mode
#
# Immediately does the following
#
# 1. Notifies players via a server broadcast that the server will be shut down
#    after a brief delay.
# 2. Shuts the server down.
# 3. Runs a backup on the server world and pushes it to S3.
#
#
# NOTE: This assumes that the "minecraft" tmux session is available and the
# first pane is the one the minecraft server and console is running in.
